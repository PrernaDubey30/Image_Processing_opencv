# Image Processing with AWS Rekognition
This repository shows an advanced image processing project that integrates AWS Rekognition, a powerful service provided by Amazon Web Services, to perform various image analysis tasks. The project is built using Python and uses key libraries like OpenCV for image manipulation and Boto3 for interaction with AWS services.

# Features-
1)Image Loading and Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for opening, displaying, and manipulating images.

2)AWS Rekognition Integration: Implements AWS Rekognition through Boto3 to analyze images for various attributes like object detection, facial analysis, and text recognition.

# Libraries Used
-OpenCV: For handling and processing images.

-Boto3: AWS SDK for Python, used to access AWS Rekognition services.
